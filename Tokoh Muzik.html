<p>Beethoven was born into a musical family. He could play the harpsichord at the age of 4 and performed on stage at the age of 8, earning him the reputation of a "musical prodigy". He studied under the famous Prussian music educator Nie Fei and began his career as a "music servant" at the age of 12. At the age of 17, he was praised for his visit to Mozart, and at the age of 19, he composed a choral piece expressing his desire for freedom and democracy. He fell out of love at the age of 30 and became deaf after that. However, he determined to engage in music creation and created many classic works, such as "Eroica Symphony"</p>
